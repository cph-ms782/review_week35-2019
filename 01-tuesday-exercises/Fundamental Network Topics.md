* **What is your public IP address right now, and how did you find it?**
    * Home: 92.243.255.37
    * School: 5.179.80.204
    * By using _whatismyipaddress.com_ or _whois_

* **What is your private IP address right now (do this both at home and in school), and who/what gave you that address?**
    * Home: 192.168.1.112  
    * School:5.179.80.204  
    ifconfig

* **What’s special about these address ranges?  
__10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 - Class A  
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 - Class B  
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 - Class C__**  
They are reserved ranges, for private networks

* **What’s special about this ip-address: 127.0.0.1?**  
It's the address of localhost.

* **What kind of service would you expect to find on a server using these ports:  
22    SSH  
23    Telnet  
25    SMTP  
53    DNS  
80    HTTP  
443   HTTPS**  

* **What is the IP address of studypoints.dk and how did you find it?**  
138.197.250.151  
traceroute studypoint.dk

* **If you write https://studypoints.dk in your browser, how did “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?**  
It called the nearest DNS server for the IP address. If it couldn't find it, it called the next up till the ROOT NAME server.

* **Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both**
    * The IP address is the path and address for a device.
    * The port is for handling different apps on the device

* **What is your (nearest) DNS server?**

* **What is (conceptually) the DNS system and the purpose with a DNS Server?**

* **What is your current Gateway, and how did you find it?**

* **What is the address of your current DHCP-Server, and how did you find it?**

* **Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack**

* **Explain about the HTTP Protocol (the following exercises will go much deeper into this protocol)**

* **Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where does it fit into TCP/IP)**
